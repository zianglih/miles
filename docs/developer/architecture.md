# Architecture Overview

A reading guide before you start patching.

## The processes

A Miles run is three kinds of processes wrapped in a Ray cluster:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Ray cluster
        subgraph "Trainer (1+ Megatron group)"
            T1[Actor rank 0]
            T2[Actor rank 1]
            T3[Actor rank ...]
        end
        subgraph "Rollout (N SGLang servers + Miles Router)"
            R1[SGLang server 1]
            R2[SGLang server 2]
            MR[Miles Router]
            R1 -. health, route .- MR
            R2 -. health, route .- MR
        end
        D[Data Source<br/>RolloutDataSourceWithBuffer]
        T1 <-- weight sync --> R1
        T1 <-- weight sync --> R2
        D --> MR
        MR --> D
    end
```

* **Trainer ranks** — Megatron processes that load `torch_dist` checkpoints and run the
  RL loop.
* **SGLang servers** — independent HTTP services that produce rollouts.
* **Miles Router** — FastAPI proxy that distributes rollout requests, preserves
  metadata (R3), and enforces health checks.
* **Data Source** — Python object owned by the trainer; reads prompt JSONL and acts as
  a buffer between rollout and training.

## The package layout

```text
miles/
├── backends/
│   ├── megatron_utils/   # fp32 markers, optimizer offload helpers, weight sync
│   ├── sglang_utils/     # SGLang glue
│   ├── training_utils/   # loss / GRPO / PPO / GSPO / REINFORCE++ plumbing
│   └── experimental/
│       └── fsdp_utils/   # FSDP-flavoured trainer (in progress)
├── ray/                  # Ray actors + rollout driver
├── rollout/
│   ├── sglang_rollout.py # default rollout function
│   ├── data_source.py    # buffer + JSONL loader
│   ├── filter_hub/       # built-in filters
│   └── inference_rollout/# experimental refactor
├── router/               # FastAPI proxy + middleware engine (router.py)
└── utils/                # async, types, IO, distributed helpers, arguments.py
```

`train.py` and `train_async.py` are the two entry points. They're thin: ~200 lines
each. Most logic lives in the modules above.

## A request's life

For a single GRPO iteration:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Trainer
    participant DS as DataSource
    participant MR as MilesRouter
    participant SG as SGLang
    participant RM as RewardFn

    T->>DS: get_samples(N)
    DS-->>T: prompts
    T->>MR: generate(prompts)
    MR->>SG: dispatch
    SG-->>MR: responses + meta_info
    MR-->>T: samples
    T->>RM: score(samples)
    RM-->>T: rewards
    T->>T: GRPO loss / step
    T->>SG: weight_sync(p2p)
```

This is the sync path. Async (`train_async.py` + `--rollout-function-path
fully_async_rollout.generate_rollout_fully_async`) breaks the request from the trainer
loop and uses a continuously-running worker.

## Where common changes go

| You want to … | Edit |
|---|---|
| Add a new RL algorithm | `miles/backends/training_utils/loss.py` + enum in `miles/utils/arguments.py` |
| Add a new built-in reward type | `miles/rollout/sglang_rollout.py` (rm dispatch) |
| Add a new built-in filter | `miles/rollout/filter_hub/` |
| Wrap a new model architecture | `miles_plugins/models/<model>.py` + `mbridge` |
| Add a new flag | `miles/utils/arguments.py` |
| Change weight sync | `miles/backends/megatron_utils/update_weight/` and `miles/utils/distributed_utils.py` |
| Change rollout buffer | `miles/rollout/data_source.py` |

## Extension points (the right way)

The trainer is plug-in-friendly. Most extensions don't need a code change inside Miles —
just pass a `--something-path my_pkg.thing`. See [Customization](../user-guide/customization.md)
for the full list.

If you find yourself patching the trainer to make something work, that's a sign we're
missing a hook. Open an issue.

## Tests

```text
tests/
├── fast/             # fast, no GPU
├── ci/               # CI-gated suite
├── e2e/              # end-to-end (spins up Ray + SGLang)
└── utils/            # shared test helpers
```

Run `pytest tests/fast` for a quick check; run `tests/e2e` before landing anything that
touches the train loop.

## Where to look first when reading the code

If you have 30 minutes and want to understand Miles end-to-end:

1. `train.py` — the loop, top-to-bottom.
2. `miles/rollout/sglang_rollout.py:generate_rollout` — how prompts become samples.
3. `miles/backends/training_utils/loss.py` — the loss and advantage computation.
4. `miles/router/router.py` — the FastAPI proxy.
5. `miles/utils/distributed_utils.py` — weight sync.

That's the spine. Everything else hangs off it.
