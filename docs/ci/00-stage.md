# Stage

A *stage* is one CI job in `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml`. A *suite* is the `suite=` value a test declares in `register_*_ci(...)`. Stage names and suite names are the same set, mapped **1:1**: a test runs in exactly the stage whose name equals its `suite`.

## Suite → stage mapping

The canonical suite list is `CI_SUITES` in `tests/ci/run_suite.py`, grouped by hardware backend (CPU / CUDA / ROCm). Cadence does not change this inventory: regular and nightly runs use the same stages. Every CPU and CUDA entry has one matching job in `pr-test.yml`; the ROCm entries are outside this workflow's roster. A test picks its stage purely by `suite=`; the stage job runs `run_suite.py --suite <name>`, which collects exactly the tests carrying that suite.

The mapping is kept in sync by hand on both sides:
- A `suite=` with no matching job never runs.
- A stage job whose suite no test uses runs zero tests and exits 0 (intended during incremental migration).

Stage names follow `stage-<tier>-<gpus>-<hw>` (or `stage-<tier>-<hw>` for CPU, e.g. `stage-a-cpu`): `tier ∈ {a, b, c}` classifies cost/role, `gpus` is the GPU count the test needs, `hw ∈ {cpu, h100, h200}` is the hardware class.

## Stage roster

| Stage / suite | Hardware | Runner labels (`runs_on`) | Shards | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `stage-a-cpu` | GitHub-hosted CPU | — (`ubuntu-latest`) | 4 | `resolve-ci-policy`, `resolve-ci-image` |
| `stage-b-cpu` | GitHub-hosted CPU | — (`ubuntu-latest`) | 1 | `resolve-ci-policy`, `resolve-ci-image` |
| `stage-b-2-gpu-h200` | 2× H200 | `["h200","2gpu"]` | 1 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-2-gpu-h200` | 2× H200 | `["h200","2gpu"]` | 2 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-4-gpu-h200` | 4× H200 | `["h200","4gpu"]` | 3 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-8-gpu-h100` | 8× H100 | `["h100","8gpu"]` | 2 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |
| `stage-c-8-gpu-h200` | 8× H200 | `["h200","8gpu"]` | 2 | both resolvers, `stage-a-cpu` |

`tier a` (CPU fast) gates the GPU fleet after both resolvers; the GPU stages (`b` / `c`) all depend on both resolvers and `stage-a-cpu`, and run concurrently with each other — the `b` / `c` letters classify role, they are not a sequential pipeline.

## What each stage does

**Image resolution (`resolve-ci-image`).** Before the GPU stages, a small `ubuntu-latest` job resolves the container image: it reads `ci-image-tag:` from the PR description (or the `ci_image_tag` dispatch input), defaults to `dev`, validates it is a bare tag, and outputs `radixark/miles:<tag>`. Every GPU stage uses this as its `container_image`. Distinct from this, the **`run-ci-image` label** selects the image scope — every enabled tag except `long`, `ft-short`, and `ft-long` — which validates an image bump without selecting those domains implicitly.

**Policy resolution (`resolve-ci-policy`).**

- `pull_request`, `schedule`, and `workflow_dispatch` only say how the workflow started; none itself implies a cadence or domain scope.
- The workflow job passes trigger facts to `tests/ci/ci_policy.py` and publishes its `cadence`, `raw_labels`, and `bypass_fastfail` outputs. That module owns trigger adaptation and the shared `resolve_policy` consumed by `run_suite.py`.
- A PR `nightly` label maps to nightly cadence.
- A scheduled run maps its exact `github.event.schedule` cron: the current `0 15 * * *` entry maps to nightly, an unknown cron fails, and a future weekly entry must add its own mapping.
- A manual dispatch keeps regular cadence and has no PR labels, so it runs the ordinary always-on selection; its operation inputs do not broaden CI scope.

A **nightly** policy selects every enabled tag except `ft-long`, admits both regular and `nightly=True` registrations, and disables fast-fail. Regular cadence admits only regular registrations. Both cadences use the same stage inventory.

`run-ci-all` selects the full domain-tag set without changing cadence. `run-ci-image` selects every enabled tag except `long`, `ft-short`, and `ft-long`. If scope signals overlap, the precedence is `run-ci-all` > nightly > `run-ci-image`. The resolved cadence and raw/synthetic labels are passed to `run_suite.py`, which computes one run policy (see docs/ci/01-label.md for the subtraction semantics).

**Dependencies / gating.** Both CPU stages require both resolvers. GPU stages also require both resolvers and, by default, a successful `stage-a-cpu`, so a CPU-test failure short-circuits the expensive GPU fleet. Resolved nightly cadence and the `bypass-fastfail` PR label relax only the `stage-a-cpu` failure gate and make each suite continue after a test failure; neither bypasses resolver failure.

**Runner selection.** GPU stages request runners by label via `runs_on`, a JSON list passed through to `runs-on` — a runner must carry **all** listed labels (GPU class + count). CPU stages set `cpu_runner: true` and run on GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` instead, so they don't occupy GPU-fleet slots.

**Dependency boundary.** GPU stages start from dependencies baked into `radixark/miles`, reconcile Miles runtime dependencies from `requirements.txt`, update the SGLang and Megatron-LM checkouts to the selected refs, and expose all three source trees through `PYTHONPATH`; they do not rebuild or install the Miles, SGLang, or Megatron-LM source trees after the container starts. The hosted CPU stages install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and the fully pinned `tests/ci/requirements-ci-cpu.txt`, then expose the Miles, SGLang, and Megatron-LM source trees through `PYTHONPATH` without editable installs or inline package lists.

**Launch.** Every stage is a thin caller of the reusable workflow `_run-ci.yml` (`uses: ./.github/workflows/_run-ci.yml`). The stage passes only `execute_command`, `runs_on`, `container_image`, and `cpu_runner`; `_run-ci.yml` owns the rest — starting the container, waiting for the GPU to be ready, reconciling Miles requirements and synchronizing external source refs for GPU jobs or installing the hosted CPU requirements, verifying source resolution, then running `execute_command` twice (once `--list-only` to print the plan, then for real). The stage itself holds no test logic; it is purely "which runner, which image, which command".

**Secrets.** Stages call the reusable workflow with `secrets: inherit`, so `_run-ci.yml` receives the caller's secrets (e.g. `WANDB_API_KEY`) without re-declaring each one.

**Sharding.** A stage with a `partition_id` matrix splits its tests across N shards; `run_suite.py` balances the shards by each test's `est_time`. Each shard is an independent job instance running the same `execute_command` with a different `--auto-partition-id`.

## Assumptions

- Suite ↔ stage stays 1:1 and is kept in sync manually across `run_suite.py` and `pr-test.yml`.
- Runner placement assumes the live fleet actually carries the requested `runs_on` labels for each GPU class and count.
- `est_time` only affects shard balancing and per-file timeout, never pass/fail.
