"""Daytona-sandbox variant of the OpenEnv tbench2 agent function.

A drop-in alternative to ``openenv_agent_function.run`` for
``--custom-agent-function-path``: instead of sharing one env server
(OPENENV_ENV_URL), every episode gets its OWN Daytona cloud sandbox — built
from the task's OFFICIAL image plus an env server layer, deleted when the
episode ends. Full per-task image fidelity with zero shared infrastructure
(no Docker host, no long-lived env server) and zero cross-episode state
leakage.

The agent loop and training wrapper live in ``openenv_agent_function``
(sibling module) and are reused unchanged; this module only supplies its own
``run_episode`` — how an env comes into being and which server contract it
speaks (``native_evaluate``, see the episode-wiring note there). The image
recipe lives in ``tb2_sandbox_recipe`` and its Daytona materialization in
``tb2_sandbox_daytona``; the recipe bakes the installed ``tbench2_env``
package -- OpenEnv's Terminal-Bench-2 environment package -- into the image,
so this variant needs the pinned tbench2_env install from the README
(canonical test.sh scoring and verifier-asset withholding built into the
server).

Env vars (the agent-loop ones in ``openenv_agent_function`` apply too):
  OPENENV_TB2_TASKS_DIR        path to a terminal-bench-2 checkout: build the
                     sandbox declaratively per episode. Daytona caches image
                     layers by definition hash, so only the first episode of a
                     task builds (~10 min); repeats start in ~1 min. No named
                     snapshots, so no org snapshot quota.
  DAYTONA_API_KEY              the Daytona API key, authenticating every
                     sandbox create/delete. Read from the worker's own
                     node-local environment; nothing forwards it. Supply it
                     via platform-injected pod env, or by exporting it in
                     the shell that starts ray on a single host.
  DAYTONA_API_KEY_FILE         fallback when DAYTONA_API_KEY is unset: path
                     of a file holding the key (default
                     ~/.config/daytona/api_key). Launchers forward this path
                     instead of the key itself, because ray runtime_env is
                     logged in plaintext. Point it at a file every node can
                     read: a dotfile, K8s Secret mount, or shared-FS path.
  OPENENV_DAYTONA_CREATE_CONCURRENCY  max in-flight sandbox creates (default 4).
  OPENENV_DAYTONA_READY_TIMEOUT_S     server-ready wait per sandbox (default 300).
  TB2_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_S        per-exec timeout inside the sandbox (default 900).
