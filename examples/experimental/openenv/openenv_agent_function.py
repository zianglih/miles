"""OpenEnv Terminal-Bench-2 <-> miles adapter.

miles selects the policy and calls ``run`` once per episode via
``--custom-agent-function-path openenv_agent_function.run``. The episode drives
the OpenEnv tbench2 env through an agentic loop (reset -> {policy -> exec} ->
evaluate).

The policy is always reached at ``base_url/v1`` through miles' session server,
so token ids + logprobs + loss masks are captured natively (no re-tokenization)
on every turn of the multi-turn episode.

Env vars:
  OPENENV_ENV_URL    base_url of the env server (default: http://localhost:8003).
  OPENENV_MAX_TURNS  multi-turn cap (default: 30)
  OPENENV_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_S  per-message WS recv timeout (default: 600; docker-mode
                     reset/exec/pytest routinely exceed the client default of 60)
  OPENENV_MAX_ROLLOUT_TIME_SECONDS  hard wall-clock cap for one episode (default:
                     3600). An episode that does not return within the limit is
                     terminated and scored reward 0 (bounds long-trajectory
                     stragglers that would otherwise stall the whole rollout batch).
  AGENT_MODEL_NAME   model name sent to the policy (default: "model")
  MILES_ROUTER_EXTERNAL_HOST  optional host rewrite for off-cluster agents
  OPENENV_TASK_WORKDIR  container dir every agent command + eval runs in (default:
                     /app, the TB2 task image WORKDIR). Empty string disables the
                     prefix. Needed because upstream OpenEnv defaults to /task.
  OPENENV_TB2_TESTS_SRC  where the upstream env stages the task's tests inside the
                     container (default: /task/tests); copied to /tests for test.sh.

Daytona-sandbox variant: ``openenv_daytona_agent_function`` (sibling module)
is a drop-in ``--custom-agent-function-path`` alternative that runs every
episode in its own Daytona cloud sandbox. It reuses this module's
agent loop and training wrapper, supplying only its own run_episode (see the
episode-wiring note below); its env vars are documented there.

# /logs/verifier/reward.txt. We reproduce that faithfully from the adapter --
# without patching OpenEnv or vendoring it -- by (a) running every agent command
# in _TASK_WORKDIR and (b) driving the canonical harness through a plain `exec`
# step instead of the env's built-in (non-canonical) `evaluate` action.
