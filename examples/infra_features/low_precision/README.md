# FP8 training examples

This is an example of FP8 training and FP8 inference. Under FP8 training and inference, it can achieve more efficient inference throughput and lower training-inference mismatch, resulting in more stable training. More details can be found in [this blog](https://lmsys.org/blog/2025-11-25-fp8-rl/).

* `run-qwen3-4b-fp8.sh`: example launch script with Qwen3‑4B in FP8.

* `run-qwen3-30b-a3b-fp8-two-nodes.sh`: example launch script for running Qwen3‑30B‑A3B in FP8 across two nodes.

## Quick Start

1. Check if your training script is properly configured.

   For training tasks, we need to add these flags:
   ```bash
   --fp8-format e4m3
   --fp8-recipe blockwise
   # --fp8-param-gather # [optional] Currently incompatible with CPU Adam
   ```
   Then ensure the `NVTE_FP8_BLOCK_SCALING_FP32_SCALES` environment variable is enabled.

   Note that only `Linear` and `GroupLinear` layers in TransformerEngine use fp8 format. `embedding` and `lm_head` remain in their original precision. If `--fp8-param-gather` is not enabled, weights in TransformerEngine remain in bf16 format, only being cast to fp8 format during `GEMM` or `GroupGEMM` operations.

2. Convert your HuggingFace model weights to FP8 format.

   You can use `tools/convert_hf_to_fp8.py` to convert bf16 weights to fp8 format. Ensure that the `--hf-checkpoint` parameter points to a directory where the `config.json` contains the correct `quantization_config`. miles will automatically use FP8 quantization during weight updates.

3. Start FP8 training.

   ```bash
   cd miles

   # Qwen3‑4B FP8 training (single node)
   bash examples/infra_features/low_precision/run-qwen3-4b-fp8.sh

   # Qwen3‑30B‑A3B FP8 training (two nodes)
   bash examples/infra_features/low_precision/run-qwen3-30b-a3b-fp8-two-nodes.sh
   ```
   Following the above command will launch FP8 training.

4. Use the saved checkpoint for evaluation.

   Note that TransformerEngine does not specifically save FP8 quantized weights; the saved torch dist remains in original precision (usually bf16). If you want to evaluate under FP8, you need to convert the checkpoint from `torch_dist` to HuggingFace format, then convert to FP8 HuggingFace format.


## Quick Explanation

Here's a quick explanation of how FP8 training is currently implemented in miles:

1. Initialization: If FP8 recipe is enabled, layers will be built in FP8 context.

2. Training: During training, weights and activations are quantized online to nvfp8 format, and cuBLAS FP8 GEMM is called for various GEMM computations in forward and backward passes.

3. Weight updates: During RL weight updates, Megatron first dequantizes FP8 weights to bf16 format, then miles quantizes these bf16 weights to fp8 format and sends them to sglang. (This additional dequantization and quantization is not elegant, but we haven't modified the interface yet for framework compatibility.)

4. Save checkpoint: Similar to weight updates, if checkpoints need to be saved from the training engine, they will also be dequantized back to bf16 and saved to `torch_dist` format checkpoints.

### MoE weight updates

With `--megatron-to-hf-mode raw`, MoE weight updates require
`--expert-tensor-parallel-size 1`. Each EP rank owns complete local routed experts.
Their conversion and quantization are split into contiguous expert ranges across
its expert-DP replicas, so each expert is processed once. For example, with two
expert-DP replicas, each processes half of the local experts. Converted tensors
and scales are then gathered as required by the weight-transfer protocol.

The same path serves unquantized weights and all rollout quantization formats
supported by the direct exporter. Quantization exclusions still apply. Shared experts and nonexpert layers retain
their existing gathering and conversion behavior. The Bridge exporter is unchanged.


## TODO

Currently, FP8 is far from being a complete feature and still has the following bugs, for examples:

- FP8 weights (`--fp8-param-gather`) can provide memory savings benefits, but currently FP8 weights must be used with TransformerEngine's FusedAdam, which conflicts with the commonly used Adam CPU offload technique in Megatron-LM.

The miles team will continue to collaborate with the NVIDIA team to contribute more complete FP8 training infrastructure to the community.

## INT4 Training Examples

This guide provides examples for INT4 STE (Straight-Through Estimator) training and INT4 inference. Utilizing INT4 inference significantly improves throughput, thereby accelerating the training pipeline (specifically during the rollout generation phase).

### Files

*   `run-qwen3‑30B‑A3B-int4.sh`: Launch script for **Qwen3‑30B‑A3B** (INT4) on 8x H200 GPUs.
*   `run-qwen3-235B-A22B-int4.sh`: Launch script for **Qwen3-235B-A22B** (INT4) on 64x H200 GPUs.
*   `run-kimi-k2-Thinking-int4.sh`: Launch script for **Kimi-k2-Thinking** (INT4) on 256x H200 GPUs.

### Quick Start

#### 1. Convert HuggingFace Weights to INT4
First, download the PTQ (Post-Training Quantization) calibration dataset from HuggingFace:
[https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/wikitext/tree/main/wikitext-2-raw-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/wikitext/tree/main/wikitext-2-raw-v1)

Next, use the `tools/convert_hf_to_hf_int4.py` script to convert BF16 weights to INT4 format. Ensure that the `--hf-checkpoint` parameter points to a directory where `config.json` contains the correct `quantization_config`. miles will automatically utilize INT4 quantization during weight updates.

```bash
python tools/convert_hf_to_hf_int4.py \
  --input-dir /path/to/your/original/models \
  --output-dir /path/to/your/save/models \
  --data-dir /path/to/your/wikitext
```

#### 2. Start INT4 Training

You need to configure the specific environment variables for quantization settings.

**Environment Variables:**

*   **`OPEN_TRAINING_INT4_FAKE_QAT_FLAG`**: Enables fake quantization operations for INT4 training.
*   **`OPEN_TRAINING_INT4_GROUP_SIZE`**: Specifies the block size (group size) for model quantization.
    *   Set to **128** for `qwen3-30B-A3B` and `qwen3-235B-A22B-int4`.
    *   Set to **32** for `kimi-k2-Thinking-int4`.

**Configuration Example:**

```json
RUNTIME_ENV_JSON="{
  \"env_vars\": {
    ...
    \"OPEN_TRAINING_INT4_FAKE_QAT_FLAG\": \"1\",
    \"OPEN_TRAINING_INT4_GROUP_SIZE\": \"128\"
  }
}"
```

**Launch Commands:**

```bash
# Qwen3‑30B‑A3B Int4 training
bash examples/infra_features/low_precision/run-qwen3‑30B‑A3B-int4.sh

# Qwen3-235B-A22B Int4 training (8 nodes)
bash examples/infra_features/low_precision/run-qwen3-235B-A22B-int4.sh

# Kimi-k2-Thinking Int4 training (32 nodes)
bash examples/infra_features/low_precision/run-kimi-k2-Thinking-int4.sh
```

- For multi-node environments, please start the Ray service according to your cluster configuration.
