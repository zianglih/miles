"""Tests for wait_for_server_ready in http_utils.

wait_for_server_ready() polls a TCP port in a loop until the server is
accepting connections.  Each iteration:
  1. Check if the process is still alive (if a process handle was given).
  2. Try ``socket.create_connection((host, port))``.
  3. If it connects → server is ready, return.
  4. If OSError (connection refused) → sleep 0.5s, retry.
  5. If ``time.time()`` exceeds the deadline → raise RuntimeError.

TestWaitForServerReady uses real sockets/threads to verify end-to-end
behaviour (port already open, delayed open, timeout, dead process).

TestWaitForServerReadySimulatedDelays uses mocks to test long startup
delays (5s / 10s / 20s) without actually waiting.  The trick:
  - Mock ``time.time()``  → returns a fake clock that we control.
  - Mock ``time.sleep()`` → doesn't really wait, just advances the fake clock.
  - Mock ``socket.create_connection()`` → raises OSError for the first N
    calls (simulating "port not ready"), then returns a fake socket
    (simulating "port ready").
This lets us simulate 20 seconds of polling in <1ms of real time.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Simulated-delay tests (mock time + socket so tests run instantly)
#
# How it works:
#   wait_for_server_ready() calls time.time() / time.sleep() / socket.create_connection()
#   in a loop.  We replace all three:
#
#   - fake_time_fn():  returns a counter we control (starts at 0.0)
#   - fake_sleep(d):   advances the counter by d (no real waiting)
#   - fake_connect():  raises OSError for the first N calls, then succeeds
#
#   This makes the loop run through all its iterations at full speed while
#   the function "thinks" real time is passing.  A 20s simulated delay
#   finishes in <1ms of wall-clock time.
