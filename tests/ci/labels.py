"""Canonical CI label registry.

Tests declare a domain label set in `register_cuda_ci(..., labels=[...])` and
`register_cpu_ci(..., labels=[...])`. The PR-side trigger for each label is
`run-ci-<key>`: each entry below MUST have a matching `run-ci-<key>` label in
the GitHub repo (maintainer-managed).

Adding a new label:
1) Add an entry below.
2) Create the matching `run-ci-<key>` label in GitHub repo Settings -> Labels.
   The workflow does not need editing -- the generic stage job filters tests
   by labels at runtime.

The workflow-only scope labels (`run-ci-all`, `run-ci-image`, `nightly`) are
intentionally NOT listed here: they select a broad scope or cadence, which
`tests/ci/ci_policy.py` `resolve_policy` maps to an include-label set drawn
from the registry below.
