    The workflow adapter resolves trigger-specific facts into a cadence and

    test runs iff it is cadence-eligible and declares no labels (always-run)
    or any of its labels is in the effective include set.

    Broad scopes are large include sets: `run-ci-all` includes every registered
    label, nightly cadence everything except `ft-long`, and `run-ci-image`
    everything except `long`, `ft-short`, and `ft-long`. Branch order encodes
    the precedence `run-ci-all` > nightly > `run-ci-image`.

    Explicitly requested `run-ci-<x>` labels are unioned in last, so an
    explicit request always wins over a scope subtraction. A subtraction is
    not a per-test veto: a test carrying a subtracted label still runs when
    another of its labels is included.
